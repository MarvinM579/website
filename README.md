Welcome to the freeCodeCamp Houston Website repo. See below for key links to help in collaborating on the website.

### Slack
We will be using the freeCodeCamp Houston Slack ([freeCodeCampHouston](https://freeCodeCampHouston.slack.com)) to help communicate and collaborate on the site. To get added to the group reach out to Jason Ephraim, Josh Davidson, or Jeremiah Wise on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/freecodecampHouston-Midtown/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.houston). If you're new to Slack you can get up to speed by checking out their [intro guide](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users).
